- Problem: 1.5 One Away
    There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a
    character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one
    edit (or zero edits) away.

- Example:
    pale, ple -> true
    pales, pale -> true
    pale, bale -> true
    pale, bake -> false

- My approach to solve this problem:
    - First, check the length of two strings to see they are more than one edit away.
    - Assuming the string as ASCII chars.
    - Define a boolean isEdited to assign it to false initially.
    - Define a bigger and smaller string and assign them based on the size.
    - Go through shorter string in a loop, and if a char is different, set isEdited to true
    - If the length of strings are different, make sure to update index of shorter string by
    decrementing it.
    - If we see the difference again, return false.
    - After going though the loop we know that they are one or zero edit away.
