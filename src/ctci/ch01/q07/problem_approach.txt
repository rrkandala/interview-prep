- Problem: Rotate Matrix
    Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
    bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

- My 1st approach to solve this problem:
    - Make a new 2D array for the output matrix.
    - Loop through the original sD array vertically from bottom to up (inner loop).
    - Loop through horizontally from left to right (outer loop).
        - Inside the loop, get the value from original 2D array and then paste it to the output
        2D array (in the normal order, from left to right, top to bottom).

- Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(N^2)
    - Space complexity: O(N^2)

- Improvements/Comments
    - In the worst case the space complexity is N^2 so that I should solve this problem in place.
    - To do that, swap each side of the matrix in clockwise
