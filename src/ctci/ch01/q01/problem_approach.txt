1.1 Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine whether a string has all unique characters.
    What if you can't use additional data structures?

- My approach to this problem
    - Make a boolean array of size 128 (size of ASCII chars)
    - Go through each character of the string in a loop, define the integer location of each char in
      boolean array, check if the location in the array is true. If the spot is true, there are more
      than one character that is same as the other. Therefore, it's not all unique characters.
      Return false if it's true.
    - Each time going through a character, make sure to mark in the boolean array that we have the
      character.
    - After going through the whole array, we made sure that there was no duplicates in any
      character, so we can return true.
