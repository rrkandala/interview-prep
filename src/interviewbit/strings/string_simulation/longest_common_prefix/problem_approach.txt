- Problem: Longest Common Prefix
    Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

    Longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the
    prefix of both S1 and S2.

    As an example, longest common prefix of "abcdefgh" and "abcefgh" is "abc".

    Given the array of strings, you need to find the longest S which is the prefix of ALL the
    strings in the array.

- Example:
    Given the array as:

    [

      "abcdefgh",

      "aefghijk",

      "abcefgh"

    ]

    The answer would be “a”.

- My approach to solve this problem:
    - First, find the minimum length string from the input array.
    - Then, loop through the array till the minimum length and at each loop, go through all strings
    in the array at specific index and check if a char at certain index is all same in array.

- Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(S * N) where S is the length of the shortest string in the array and N is
    the size of the array.
    - Space complexity: O(1)
