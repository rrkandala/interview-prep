- Problem: Palindrome String
    Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and
    ignoring cases.

- Example:
    "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.

    "race a car" is not a palindrome.

    Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem

- My approach to solve this problem:
    - Going through a loop, get the far left character(start) and far right character(end), and if
    they are not the same return 0. If the char is not digit or number, update start and end. Loop
    should end when start <= end.

- Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(N) where N is the length of the input string
    - Space complexity: O(1)

- Improvements/Comments
    - I could have solved this without using "isDigit()" or "isLetter()" methods. If we have a char
    array, we can use "arr[i] >= 'a' && arr[i] <= 'z'" to check if the char is letter or not.
