- Problem: Implement StrStr
    Implement strStr().

     strstr - locate a substring ( needle ) in a string ( haystack ).
    Try not to use standard library string functions for this question.

    Returns the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of
    haystack.

- Note:
    What should be the return value if the needle is empty?
    What if both haystack and needle are empty?
    For the purpose of this problem, assume that the return value should be -1 in both cases.

- My approach to solve this problem:
    - Loop through heystack and check if each char is same as the first character of needle.
    - Once we find a needle first char, loop through needle and see if all the characters of needle
    match with substrings of heystack.

- Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(A * B) where A is a length of heystack and B is a length of needle
    - Space complexity: O(1)

- Improvements/Comments
    - To make it linear time from quadratic time, we can use KMP algorithm.
