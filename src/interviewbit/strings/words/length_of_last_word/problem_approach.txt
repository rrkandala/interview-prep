- Problem: Length Of Last Word
    Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return
    the length of last word in the string.

    If the last word does not exist, return 0.

- Example:
    Given s = "Hello World",

    return 5 as length("World") = 5.

    Please make sure you try to solve this problem without using library functions. Make sure you
    only traverse the string once.

- Note:
    A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

- My approach to solve this problem:
    - Since we just want the length of last word, we can traverse from the end of the input string
    and return the count when we encounter with space.

- Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(N) where N is the character length of input string.
    - Space complexity: O(1)
