- Problem: Prime Sum
    Given an even number ( greater than 2 ), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to
    given number.

- Example:
    Input : 4
    Output: 2 + 2 = 4

- Note:
    - A solution will always exist. read Goldbachâ€™s conjecture
    - If there are more than one solutions possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.

        If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b,
        and [c,d] is another solution with c <= d, then

        [a, b] < [c, d]

        If a < c OR a==c AND b < d.

- My observation:
    - prime numbers: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17, ...
    - 4 --> 2,2
      6 --> 3,3
      8 --> 3,5
      10 --> 5,5
      12 --> 5,7
      14 --> 7,7
      16 --> 5,11
      18 --> 7,11
      20 --> 3,17
      22 --> 11,11
    - Notice: when N is divided by 2, we get a number x,
        - One of the pair is less than x
        - The other of the pair is more than x

- My approach to solve this problem:
    - Make a function to check if a given integer is a prime number.
    - We only need to search up to the half value of N, so loop through integers from 2 to N/2,
    and check if each integer x is prime and N - x is also prime.

- Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(sqrt(N) * N)
    - Space complexity: O(1)
