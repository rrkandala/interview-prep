- Problem: Greatest Common Divisor
    Given 2 non negative integers m and n, find gcd(m, n)

    GCD of 2 integers m and n is defined as the greatest integer g such that g is a divisor of both
    m and n. Both m and n fit in a 32 bit signed integer.

- Example:
    m : 6
    n : 9

    GCD(m, n) : 3

- Note:
    DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTIONS

- My observation:
    - gcd(15, 9)
        15 % 9 = 6
        9 % 6 = 3
        6 % 3 = 0

    - gcd(7, 3)
        7 % 3 = 1


- My approach to solve this problem:
    - Find minimum and maximum of two integers
    - Recursively find gcd
        - Start from (max % min = remainder)
        - Set 2 base cases where remainder is 1 (return 1) and remainder is 0(return the min)
        - Each time update max = min, min = remainder as well.
