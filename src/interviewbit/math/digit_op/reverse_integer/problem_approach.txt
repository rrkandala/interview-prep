- Problem: Reverse Integer
    Reverse digits of an integer.

- Example:
    - x = 123,
      return 321
    - x = -123,
      return -321

- Note:
    Return 0 if the result overflows and does not fit in a 32 bit signed integer

- My approach to solve this problem:
    - Loop through each digit.
    - Get last digit by n % 10, the remaining digits by n / 10.
    - Add the last digit to output integer each time in the loop by n * 10 + lastDigit.
    - For overflow case, use long value to see if it's in range.

- Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(N) where N is the number of digits
    - Space complexity: O(1)

- Improvements/Comments
    - Instead of using long to deal with integer overflow, we can use Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 in
    a conditional statement.
