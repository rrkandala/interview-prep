- Problem: Palindrome Integer
    Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

    A palindrome integer is an integer x for which reverse(x) = x where reverse(x) is x with its
    digit reversed.
    Negative numbers are not palindromic.

- Example:
    Input : 12121
    Output : True

    Input : 123
    Output : False

- My observation:
    12121 - T
    1221 - T
    123123 - F
    10001 - T
    123 - F
    1000021 - F

    - Make sure to read the question carefully. I first thought the permutations of the integer
    count for the palindrome and implemented the different thing.

- My approach to solve this problem:
    - Convert the int to string.
    - Compare from outer pair in the loop.

- Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(N) where N is the number of digits
    - Space complexity: O(1)

- Improvements and comments:
    - I could have made a reverseString method and check to see it's same as the original string.
