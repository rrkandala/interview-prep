- Problem: Rotate Matrix
    You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

    Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

    You need to do this in place.

- Example:
    If the array is

    [
        [1, 2],
        [3, 4]
    ]
    Then the rotated array becomes:

    [
        [3, 1],
        [4, 2]
    ]

- My approach to solve this problem:
    - Loop from outer layer to inner layer
    - In inner loop, go through each side of the matrix and swap value from left to top, bottom to
    left, right to bottom and top to right.

- Complexity:
    - Time complexity: O(N^2)
    - Space complexity: O(1)

- Improvements/Comments
    - I have solved this problem before on CtCI, so I could figure out the strategy to solve this
    problem in place.
